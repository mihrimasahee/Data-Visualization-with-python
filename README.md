In this execise, plot a linear line of best fit, and use it to predict the number of immigrants in 2015.

'No. Immigrants = 5567 * Year + -10926195'

Using the equation of line of best fit, we can estimate the number of immigrants in 2015:

- No. Immigrants = 5567 * Year - 10926195
- No. Immigrants = 5567 * 2015 - 10926195
- No. Immigrants = 291,310
  
When compared to the actual from Citizenship and Immigration Canada's (CIC) 2016 Annual Report, we see that Canada accepted 271,845 immigrants in 2015. Our estimated value of 291,310 is within 7% of the actual number, which is pretty good considering our original data came from United Nations
